Testing our Git Workflow

I’ve created a repository in my own, personal (and open) Github account. And I created three branches: 
    master, beta and staging.

I’ll put some files in Staging and promote them to the other two.

Then let’s all three practice creating branches and committing/moving among the main 3 branches. If we keep the number of files small (4-5), and all simple .txt files, we should be able to easily see what’s happening.
